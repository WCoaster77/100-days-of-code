###Day 2: Jan 2nd, 2017
**Todays Progress:** Read and practiced exercises from [JavaScript Programmer's Reference](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430246299) *I got my copy at local library.* Forked repository of code examples.

**Thoughts:** I knew I was on the right track and this book is helping to clarify the variable/call back process.

###Day 1: Jan 1st, 2017
**Todays Progress:** Uploaded the work I have done on FCC Weather App Challenge
